# EDW Mapbox Integration for Drupal

## Description
This module is designed to integrate Mapbox, a leading mapping platform, into your Drupal-powered websites.
This module provides a range of features to enhance your website with interactive and customizable maps using *views*.

**Note:** This module requires a _Mapbox account and API key_.

## Prerequisites
* Geofields on your contents of type latitue/logitude or Geofield WKT

## Installation
Before enabling this module, make sure that the following modules are present in your codebase by adding them to your composer.json and running `composer update`:

```php
"require": {
  "drupal/core": "^9.4 || ^10",
  "drupal/geofield": "^1.41",
  "ext-zip": "*",
  "itamair/geophp": "^1.5"
}
```

## How to use

1. Enable the module.
2. Obtain a Mapbox API key [from your mapbox account](https://account.mapbox.com/), go to _/admin/config/system/edw_maps/settings_ and configure the module settings or add them in your _settings.local_ file:
```php
  $config['edw_maps.settings']['token'] = 'pk.xxxxxxxxxxxxx';
  $config['edw_maps.settings']['default_style_url'] = 'mapbox://styles/ccac-secretariat/cljcyeoxg000601plehvh667v';
```
3. Create a view block, select *EDW Mapbox Map* for format and *fields* for show.
4. Configure format settings: you need to select a GeoField as a source for pins/polygons display.
5. Easily embed maps into your Drupal content using a content block.

## How to style
1. To style markers use ``.edw-marker`` class in your css. You can choose a different icon or oen from the ``assets/icons`` folder:
```css
.edw-marker {
    background-image: url('mapbox-icon.png');
    background-size: cover;
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    border-radius: 50%;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```
2. To style clusters use ``.edw-cluster-marker`` class in your css.

## Altering tooltip data
You can display a rendered entity in a tooltip or any other field.
You can alter the contents of the _rendered entity_ using ``edw_maps`` hooks:
* to alter pin popup data: ``hook_edw_maps_pin_tooltip_data_alter()``
* to alter country popup data: ``hook_edw_maps_country_tooltip_data_alter()``
* to alter area popup data: ``hook_edw_maps_area_tooltip_data_alter()``

## GEOFields examples
For pins - point:
- WKT format: ``POINT (10.0 51.0)``
- GeoJson format:
```JSON
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [10.0, 51.0]
  },
  "properties": {}
}
```

For areas - polygon:
- WKT format: ``POLYGON ((73.4 42.1, 79.0 42.1, 79.0 35.8, 73.4 35.8, 73.4 42.1))``
- GeoJson format:
```JSON
  {
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [
      [
        [73.4, 42.1],
        [79.0, 42.1],
        [79.0, 35.8],
        [73.4, 35.8],
        [73.4, 42.1]
      ]
    ]
  },
  "properties": {}
}
```
